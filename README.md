### Why need it?
My laptop does not support the [Fan Profile](https://github.com/Karmel0x/AsusFanControl/assets/25367564/924d990a-bf20-4b8d-bf9d-56c460174d99) option, but it often overheats. Looked for apps to control fans, but none is working.

### Compatibility
This program should work on any laptop with x64 windows where [Fan Diagnosis](https://github.com/Karmel0x/AsusFanControl/assets/25367564/7129833b-97af-4da8-9148-b71e49552ea4) in [MyASUS](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/myasus/9N7R5S6B0ZZH) application is working as it is using same library.

[ASUS System Control Interface](https://www.asus.com/support/faq/1047338/) is necessary for this software to work - `ASUS System Analysis` service [must be running](../../issues/16). It's automatically installed with `MyASUS` app.

Included `AsusWinIO64.dll` is licenced to `(c) ASUSTek COMPUTER INC.` which can be found in `C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\asussci2.inf_amd64_-\ASUSSystemAnalysis\` if you have MyASUS installed.

[Works on](../../issues/13): 
- ASUS: VivoBook, ZenBook, TUF Gaming, ROG Strix, ROG Zephyrus, ROG Flow
